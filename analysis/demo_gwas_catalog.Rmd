This is an *R Markdown Notebook* to reproduce some of my analyses of
the GWAS Catalog data. *Add a few more sentences here about the GWAS
Catalog data, and why we might want to analyze it.*

For more background, read the [GWAS Catalog
paper](http://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkt1229). See also the [GWAS
Diagram](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/diagram) for an evocative visual
summary of the data.

Give overview of the steps in our analysis (as a list): retrieve code
and data, set up R environment, etc.

## Retrieving the code

*Instructions on cloning or downloading the github repository go
here. You should have a folder somewhere on your computer, or in your
home folder on a compute cluster, called `R-intro`.*

Think of the `R-intro` folder as our project folder; all files that are
useful for our data analysis project (code, data, other documents),
and all results we generate from these files should be saved within
this folder. This will allow us to more easily keep track of our
work.

## Downloading the data

Download the file that contains all associations with added ontology
from [here](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/api/search/downloads/alternative).

Copy this file to [data](data) folder in git repository, and rename
this file as `gwas_catalog.tsv`.

See [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/fileheaders) for details on
what is contained in this file.

In summary, give full file structure:

```
R-intro/
├── README.md
├── LICENSE

```

## Setting up the R programming environment

Choose: RStudio or R + editor (e.g., emacs).

Set working directory.

## 

## Reading the data into R


```{r}
plot(cars)
```
