## General Information

[R](http://cran.r-project.org) has become one of the most important
tools in quantitative research, from computational biology to
financial modeling. This 2-hour workshop will expose participants to
the basic elements of R, a computing environment for data analysis,
through working examples. The workshop is centered around the *data
frame*â€”a data structure that resembles a spreadsheet, but can be
manipulated in R to quickly generate sophisticated visualizations and
analyses from large data sets.

No previous programming experience is required, although it is helpful
to have some familiarity with spreadsheets (e.g., Excel) since we will
draw parallels between R and Excel. The aim is to provide participants
with the basic tools to explore the features of R and
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio) on their own,
either on the RCC compute cluster, or on their own computer.

**Level:** Introductory

**Prerequistes:** PLEASE NOTE: Participants should have been exposed
to a UNIX-like shell environment, and should be able to log in to the
RCC compute cluster. All participants must bring a laptop with a Mac,
Linux, or Windows operating system that they have administrative
privileges on.

**Where:** Kathleen A. Zar Room, John Crerar Library, University of
  Chicago ([OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=john%20crerar%20library#map=18/41.79053/-87.60282)).

**Additional info:** This workshop is an attempt to apply elements of
the

interactive instruction for computing/quantitative sciences.
